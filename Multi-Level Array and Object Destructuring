const getInfo = (people) => {
  return people.map(({ name, address: { city, street: { name: streetName } } }) => 
    `${name} lives in ${city} on ${streetName}`
  );
};

How it works
Multi-level destructuring:

From each person:

{ name } → person’s name

address: { city } → city

street: { name: streetName } → street name (renamed to avoid conflict with person name)

map():

Example:-
const people = [
  {
    name: "Alice",
    address: {
      city: "New York",
      street: { name: "Broadway", number: 123 },
    },
  },
  {
    name: "Bob",
    address: {
      city: "Los Angeles",
      street: { name: "Sunset Boulevard", number: 456 },
    },
  },
];

console.log(getInfo(people));

Output:-
[
  "Alice lives in New York on Broadway",
  "Bob lives in Los Angeles on Sunset Boulevard"
]
